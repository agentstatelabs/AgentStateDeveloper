//! Vendored copy of `agent-skillgen` v0.1.0
//! (<https://github.com/agentstatelabs/agent-skillgen>, commit be42d5d).
//!
//! crates.io rejects git dependencies, and agent-skillgen is not published
//! there, so the engine is copied in rather than depended on. CTXone carries
//! the same copy. Change it upstream first, then re-copy it here and in CTXone,
//! so the two CLIs keep rendering identical skill files. The only local edits
//! are the `crate::skillgen::` paths, rustfmt's edition-2024 import order,
//! and the `#[allow]` on the `mod skillgen` line in lib.rs.
//!
//! Upstream crate docs follow.
//!
//! # agent-skillgen
//!
//! Shared agent-onboarding engine for the AgentStateLabs suite. Both
//! AgentStateDeveloper (ASD) and CTXone consume it: each supplies one
//! [`SkillSpec`] describing what the agent should know and when to reach for the
//! tool, and the engine renders per-agent `SKILL.md` files plus a host-agnostic
//! always-on instruction block — from **one source**, across the whole
//! [`platform::PLATFORMS`] registry.
//!
//! Design (mirrors graphify's `skillgen` and ASD's conformance-matrix-as-spec):
//! - **One source** — a `SkillSpec` per product (not per agent).
//! - **Deterministic render** — LF newlines, no timestamp/version in content,
//!   author-ordered rules; regenerating never churns a diff.
//! - **Drift guard** — [`render::check_or_bless`] compares against committed
//!   golden artifacts and fails on drift; `AGENT_SKILLGEN_BLESS=1` regenerates.
//!
//! What lives elsewhere: the *actual* ASD/CTX content (their `SkillSpec`s), the
//! install-time file placement, version stamping, and the cross-product nudge
//! are downstream plan tasks (suite-onboarding t-002/t-003/t-004/t-005). This
//! crate is the reusable substrate they all build on.
